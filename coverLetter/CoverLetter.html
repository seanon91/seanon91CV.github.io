		<p>
			Thank you for taking the time to review my website and consider my application. I am an APA (PGI / PMI) qualified Quality Assurance analyst with eight years’ customer service experience within the insurance industry. Through my current employer, Sedgwick, I have gained vast amounts of experience within the travel and health insurance sectors, initially as a customer service / claims agent before moving into a QA role two years ago.
			As a QA analyst, I am required to have strong product knowledge in a vast, complex industry in order to identify errors and assist service agents with queries. Excellent communication is essential in order to properly convey complicated insurance processes that agents and members can understand. It is my belief that empathy and patience are the two key foundations of great customer support. These skills have been honed over eight years of exemplary customer service.
			I am currently finishing my first year of studying Computing part-time in NCI with the intention of completing a four year BSc degree. I am eager to challenge myself and excited by the potential opportunity of furthering myself within your organisation. Thank you again for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
